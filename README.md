# WIP: Xircuits Gradio Component Library

This is a work in progress. It is mostly at the proof of concept stage. It shows everything that is needed to create gradio applications with Xircuits, but doesn't provide a lot of components for it yet.
## Prerequisites

- gradio
- makefun

## Installation

To use this component library, ensure you have Xircuits installed, then simply run:

```
xircuits install https://github.com/XpressAI/xai-gradio
```

Alternatively you may manually copy the directory / clone or submodule the repository to your working Xircuits project directory then install the packages using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Tests
A github action to test your workflow runs has been provided. Simply add the path of your workflows [here](.github/workflows/run-workflow-tests.yml#L11).
